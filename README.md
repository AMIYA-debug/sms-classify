# Word2Vec in SMS Classifier

This project uses **Word2Vec**, a neural network-based word embedding technique, to convert SMS messages into dense vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of words. Word2Vec works by analyzing the context in which words appear ,either predicting a word from its surrounding words (CBOW) or predicting surrounding words from a target word (Skip-gram) so that words with similar meanings have similar vectors. In practice, we train a Word2Vec model on our SMS corpus and then transform each message into an average of its word vectors. These vectors are then fed into a machine learning pipeline for classification. Word2Vec is widely used in NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and chatbots, making it easier for models to understand textual data beyond simple bag-of-words representations.
